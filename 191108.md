## Morning Learning

As I get closer to the fantasy baseball ML application, the architecture and tooling are solidifying in my mind. So, I'm watching [Building Cloud-native Solutions for Azure with Visual Studio](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/building-cloud-native-solutions-azure-visual-studio/table-of-contents) on Pluralsight.

## Workday Work

More fun with RavenDB data subscriptions. I finished my [proof of concept app](https://github.com/jake-bladt/ravenDB-subscriptions-poc) and started in on production code. Every subject in RavenDB seems to be miles deep and it's forcing me to rethink databases in general and NoSQL ones specifically.

## Notes

* Visual Studio now supports starting multiple projects as your "Startup Project."
* Local Azure function emulation is installed as part of the Azure development workload in Visual Studio.

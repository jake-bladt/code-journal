## Morning Learning

As I get closer to the fantasy baseball ML application, the architecture and tooling are solidifying in my mind. So, I'm watching [Building Cloud-native Solutions for Azure with Visual Studio](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/building-cloud-native-solutions-azure-visual-studio/table-of-contents) on Pluralsight.

## Notes

* Visual Studio now supports starting multiple projects as your "Startup Project."
* Local Azure function emulation is installed as part of the Azure development workload in Visual Studio.

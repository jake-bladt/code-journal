## Morning Viewing

This morning, as part of my "soup to nuts developer" track, I continued my networking essentials course on PluralSight and started a new course on Linux Email services. The latter is to address the fact that I'm primarily using HostGator for e-mail forwarders now and would like to stop spending hosting money on it (plus it's a great first Linux server project for me.)

## Workday

After triaging company-specific maintenance issues, I moved on to containerizing .net core projects.

## Evening learning

Back to the mail service videos. They're focused on the LIC certification, which I'm not pursuing now. I probably won't dive deep until the weekend.

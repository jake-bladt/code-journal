## Morning Learning

I finished the Pluralsight video on network fundamentals - lost the thread somewhere in the last couple of chapters, but I think I picked up enough to cement the course I took on docker networking. And I now understand that CIDR address ranges are just shorthand for bog-standard subnet masks.

## Workday

Work was all meetings and maintenance.

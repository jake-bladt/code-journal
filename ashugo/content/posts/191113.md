## Morning Learning

Over breakfast, I watched an overview of golang on Pluralsight. PS has several naming conventions that give you a hint as to which videos you can absorb while multitasking. Pretty much anything with "The Big Picture" in the title is one of those. Because I actually foresee a project I'd like to do in go, I'm thinking it's worth following through a couple of hands-on videos and seeing how far they take me.

## Workday

As of 14:45, my entire workday has been taken up trying to write a request that will get a bearer token for the tests I need to write for the "don't return quarantined files" functionality. It's not just me. Our QA person is just as puzzled. (By 6 pm, we'd figured it out and I moved on to the next roadblock in implementing my Postman tests.

## Evening Learning

The evening was spent playing around with Azure functions, getting comforable with them again. The biggest takeaway is that ``System.Data.SqlClient`` isn't supported in Azure functions.

## Morning study

Last night, I ran into a curious rendering bug with the hugo theme "pure" where apostraphes render with very weird kerning, embedded tabs, or something. I [communicated the issue to the developer](https://github.com/xiaoheiAh/hugo-theme-pure/issues/10) and got a very prompt response last night. I followed up this morning. I'm not planning on using that theme in production, but hopefully, I can contribute to the hugo community in some way.

I'm starting to think I need to learn golang. If I'm going to be working with docker and hugo, it would be nice to be able to contribute. I don't think any tools I currently use are written in rust.

Breakfast viewing is the Pluralsight video on setting up postfix. Because it's focused on passing the LIPC wich doesn't require supporting internet e-mail, it's probably not going to be the resource I use to walk through my own setups. I'm once again starting to think I might sit for the LIPCs as a way to fill in the gaps in my basic Linux knowledge, so I may be back for a more careful watch in the future.

## Workday

The entire workday was taken up learning about testing in Postman (see notes in independent study.) Tomorrow, I need to figure out how to generate a bearer token for the specific context I'm working in. Then, there's a clear path to finish testing.

## Evening

This evening's work focused on Azure Functions. More to come on that soon, hopefully.

## Notes

I feel like I reached a special level of Linux enlightenment when I realized I needed to do this to use my containerized, port-forwarded PostgreSQL from its host:

``psql -h localhost my_pointless_db postgres``

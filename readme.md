# Code Journal

I saw an intersting article on dev.io titled (something like) "Why You Should Journal Your Code" and, while I didn't actually read it, I was immediately convinced.

What the atticle probably said was that the greatest value of a code journal is as a letter to your future self to remind you how you solved a particular problem that may well recur and hopefully save you from the horror of not being able to find the article that has exactly the infomation you find yourself needing again.

I will (probably) eventually read the article, presuming I can find it. The author has presumably put much more thought into the topic than I have, hopefully on subjects like tooling and indexing, but markdown files in github are good enough for now.

# Journal for November 9-10

This weekend makes 28 straight days of Pluralsight viewing and the same unbroken streak in github contributions. The first was a deliberate choice, the second probably not a coincidence. I've been planning on doing a thirty-day retrospective when I hit that benchmark, but it may not come until next weekend.

Saturday, I was all geared up to start data flowing into the big draft-ninja project when I came to the realization that I just don't care enough about winning at fantasy baseball to put in the work it's going to require. I'm putting it aside, possibly for something less ambitious before draft day 2020 or maybe just muddling along like I have.

I've also decided to put F# aside for at least a week and focus on rust. F# is fascinating, but unlikely to allow me to build anything I can't already build in C#/Javascript in the next year or so. Rust has possibilities for which C#/Javascript are ill-suited. I'll revisit this decision next weekend.

Now that I have momentum, I'm once again looking at the beta-my-book project. It's more challenging than UofI, but a good combination of what I already know how to do and what I'll need to figure out. Hopefully more about that in this space soon.

This weekend, I did some fiddling with hugo (a static website generator) and watched videos about deployment, DevOps, devSecOps, and cloud native architecture. Honestly, it felt like a bit of a vacation.

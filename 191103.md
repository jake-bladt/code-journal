Working from memory as I type this on my phone over dinner.

Using vim on Termux for Android. I haven't dug too deeply into its capabilities, but it seems to be a full-featured terminal supporting bash and zsh - complete with the usual linux tools like top, ps, chmod, etc. I've managed to install git and clang, so definitely not a toy.

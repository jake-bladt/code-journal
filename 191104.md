## Morning Viewing

This morning, as part of my "soup to nuts developer" track, I continued my networking essentials course on PluralSight and started a new course on Linux Email services. The latter is to address the fact that I'm primarily using HostGator for e-mail forwarders now and would like to stop spending hosting money on it (plus it's a great first Linux server project for me.)

## Workday

After triaging company-specific maintenance issues, I moved on to containerizing .net core projects.

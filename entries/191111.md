## Morning Learning

This morning, I grazed a presentation on graph databases, but I was mostly thinking about Beta My Book. One core aspect of the BMB project is the idea of storing plain-text in git or a git-like graph/diff structure. As part of that, I've been thinking about how to write diff in C#. This morning, it finally occured to me that I should research how to not write diff in C# since it's almost certainly a previously-solved problem. A quick googlebing shows [this thread on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/138331/any-decent-text-diff-merge-engine-for-net). I'll have to follow up later.

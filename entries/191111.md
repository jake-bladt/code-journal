## Morning Learning

This morning, I grazed a presentation on graph databases, but I was mostly thinking about Beta My Book. One core aspect of the BMB project is the idea of storing plain-text in git or a git-like graph/diff structure. As part of that, I've been thinking about how to write diff in C#. This morning, it finally occured to me that I should research how to not write diff in C# since it's almost certainly a previously-solved problem. A quick googlebing shows [this thread on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/138331/any-decent-text-diff-merge-engine-for-net). I'll have to follow up later.

## Workday

Heading down the rabbit hole today. Follow the stack:
* I need to test that the functionality I wrote into CarFS to not serve quarantined files works.
* Thanks to a presentation I saw at #CodeCampNYC, I believe the best way to test this API (and another one I built that is awaiting testing) is to write Postman Scripts.
* After watching a YouTube video about automated testing and authentication in Postman, I decided that I needed a deep dive. On to Pluralsight.
* The Pluralsight tutorial (linked below) requires me to be running an API in Node with a Postgres back-end.
* Because I'm already running three different databases on my development machine, I'm leery of installing _another_ database.
* Fortunately, I have a VM on Linode running Docker. I'll just install PostgreSQL in a container and connect to it from my local machine!
* I just need to run the container, forward port 5432 to the docker host, and open that port to my dev machine. I... think that means using iptables.
* Yes, it's iptables! Good. Now, how do I open a port in iptable?
* And, more importantly, how do I keep that port open from start to start?

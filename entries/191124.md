# A retrospective on six weeks of self-training

## Overview

Some time back in September, I realized that I was coming out of a fairly long down cycle brought on at least in part by a combination of one miserable job and one deeply disillusioning one. A review of my github profile suggests that I go through a similar downturn roughly in the middle of each year, but this one was particularly long and deep. Technical learning not required for my day-to-day job more or less dried up completely in mid-May and the desire to get my head back in the game didn't come back until around the time I received the first e-mail announcing Code Camp 2019.

In preparation for Code Camp, I logged into Pluralsight to graze over some of the topics that would be covered at the one-day event. This must have triggered something because there's been no looking back. In the six weeks since, I've been on the site every day and, not entirely coincidentally, I've gotten back into the habit of using github for all sorts of things other than just code (but code, too.)

Now, I think I'm ready to start building a proper side project and a survey of what's caught my interest seems like a good place to decide what to build.

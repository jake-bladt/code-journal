## Morning learning

This morning, I started [Cloud Design Patterns for Azure: Data Management and Performance](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/azure-design-patterns-data-management-performance/table-of-contents) on Pluralsight and was surprised/pleased to find that I already have a pretty solid understanding of the autoscaling pattern, both in concept and in practice. There may be some particulars of triggering an auto-scaling event that I still need to learn, but I'm going to add this to my mental list of "things I know how to do without googlebinging."

## Notes

* SOX-404 "separation of responsibility" requirements are why we don't give developers admin access to production systems. Credit Suisse's "break-glass" accounts appear to have been a workaround for those requirements. Research and present.
* "You build it, you run it."
* Getting better at running data centers doesn't make us better at our core job.
* Human beings are too intelligent and too expensive to do manual testing and monitoring.
* DevOps is a result of a healthy culture and healthy thinking.
* Undeployed code as "inventory" and "work-in-progress" is a productivity killer. (Lean/TQM)
* Bottlenecks: Where does work wait?
* In sharded databases, does the shard manager always round-trip with the original requestor? It seems like it would sometimes be more efficient for the shard manager to pass information about the query to the shards and let them send the request back (certainly with single-source queries.)

## Morning learning

This morning, I started [Cloud Design Patterns for Azure: Data Management and Performance](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/azure-design-patterns-data-management-performance/table-of-contents) on Pluralsight and was surprised/pleased to find that I already have a pretty solid understanding of the autoscaling pattern, both in concept and in practice. There may be some particulars of triggering an auto-scaling event that I still need to learn, but I'm going to add this to my mental list of "things I know how to do without googlebinging."

## Notes

* SOX-404 "separation of responsibility" requirements are why we don't give developers admin access to production systems. Credit Suisse's "break-glass" accounts appear to have been a workaround for those requirements. Research and present.

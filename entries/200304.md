# Journal for March 4, 2020

## DevOps

Since the last time I journalled, my job title has switched from "software developer" to "DevOps engineer," so this is technically now a devops journal - except of course that I'm still primarily a coder. Putting a leopard in the tiger enclosure doesn't give it stripes.

As I haven't been journalling, this entry should be fairly heavy with links as I'm trying to close dozens of browser tabs without losing the information.

## Overview

The last few days have been a hodgepodge of new technology. I decided to work on Pilgrim, the FaaS/Microservice cluster for identity and access management and that led down the rabbit hole to looking at cloud databases to figure out which one might be a good first data store. I started learning about CosmosDB, which seemed like a good choice becuase it's cloud native and has an "all things to all people" vibe to it, but it turns out that just having an empty CosmosDB collection waiting to be used costs ~US$25 a month.

Next, I tried to set up a good old fashioned single managed instance of SQL server on Azure like I use for the gallery project, but for the life of me can't figure out how to replicate the existing setup where I pay approximately US$3-5 a month for DB usage. Everything I tried to set up ran from US$60-900 a month. I'll have to loop back to it.

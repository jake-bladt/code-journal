## Morning Learning

This weekend's core focus is to review resources that will let me talk DevOps / CI with management. I'm starting with Richard Seroter's [Implementing DevOps in the Real World](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/implementing-devops-real-world/table-of-contents) and followed with related courses on DevOps and CD/CI.

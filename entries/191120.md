# Journal for 20-Nov-2019

## Overview

The last two days have been largely overtaken with non-code responsibilities while morning videos have been dedicated to trying to figure out if Azure AD is a good solution for storing users of a web application. I'm still investigating that.

## Worday(s)

Retrospective and sprint planning took up a big chunk of my time along with discussing the big move to continuous deployment for one of our core products. Today, my non-planning time has been taken over by hiring-related issues.

I do have one big win over the last three days. The mysterious problem with configuration in our file-sharding API was happening because dotnet core's WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder uses defaults for _everything_ - including overwriting the configuration root you pass into it with one that only reads config information from the default appjason.\*.config files. Tomorrow, we begin setting up CD in earnest.

As an excercise over lunch, I tried to get [code-server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server) running on Linode. This requires a deeper dive.

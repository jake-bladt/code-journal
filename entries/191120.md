Retrospective and sprint planning took up a big chunk of my time along with discussing the big move to continuous deployment for one of our core products. Today, my non-planning time has been taken over by hiring-related issues.

I do have one big win over the last three days. The mysterious problem with configuration in our file-sharding API was happening because dotnet core's WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder uses defaults for _everything_ - including overwriting the configuration root you pass into it with one that only reads config information from the default appjason.\*.config files.

Tomorrow, we begin setting up CD in earnest.

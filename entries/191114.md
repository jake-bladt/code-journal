## Morning Learning

Today's morning viewing was a Pluralsight TL;DR on nodeJs. I'm about to make a significant technological pivot at work and don't foresee getting time to learn skills outside of testing, automation, and continuous deployment anytime in the remainder of the year, so this was a bit of nice light viewing. (I've already built and deployed node apps in production - admittedly in a fairly slipshod manner.

## Workday

My workday was split between canvassing for problems that will impede moving Dashboard to continuous deployment and trying to configure one of our products to use RavenDB in the cloud - by which I mean reading a ton on configuration in dotnet core even though it wasn't directly germane to the problem. I do love my job.

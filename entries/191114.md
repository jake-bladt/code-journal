## Morning Learning

Today's morning viewing was a Pluralsight TL;DR on nodeJs. I'm about to make a significant technological pivot at work and don't foresee getting time to learn skills outside of testing, automation, and continuous deployment anytime in the remainder of the year, so this was a bit of nice light viewing. (I've already built and deployed node apps in production - admittedly in a fairly slipshod manner.

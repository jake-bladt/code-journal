## Aha!

### Creating an Azure SQL database that costs less than my cable bill
To create an inexpensive, developer-appropriate SQL Server instance on Azure, the options are Azure SQL (not SQL Databases) _then_ SQL databases (_not_ managed instances,) - Single Database, _then_ under "Compute + Storage," select "Serverless" _or_ scroll left and select "Basic." Considering that this is the first option a developer is likely to use on Azure, it's pretty damned hard to find.

### Git is decentralized by design. Pull requests are not.
Unlike older SCM products, git is built to treat each instance of a repository as its own source of truth. Github, Bitbucket, AZP, and the like have additional tools that don't follow this ethos. Pull requests are a case in point. While it's easy to have a repo that you store in both github and Azure DevOps repos, it's a good idea to choose one of those to be a Single Source of Pull Requests and to leave your main branch (ie, ```master``` or ```develop```) free of any specific commit rules on the other.

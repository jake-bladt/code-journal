# Journal for December 9, 2019

## Overview

It's been a week since my last code journal. While I acknowledge that my enthusiasm cycle is on a downswing, I also haven't been doing much coding in that week. Having put together the continuous deployment taskforce at work, I've been doing a _lot_ of process-related work and the code that I am writing is mostly idempotent build YAML - fiddly, little bits of code that are less than inspiring.

Today was my first chance in a while to really get elbow-deep in a technical problem. The eventual solution was to realize that I was trying to run the command ```npm npm install``` instead of just ```npm install```. There's a blog entry in this.

# Overview

Resuming the code journaling exercise because I expect to be learning a lot of stuff going forward one way or another. Today's learning at work was largely about customizing the work tracking experience in Azure DevOps (formerly TFS.)

## General Observation

I've come to realize that I enjoy learning how to create things even more than I enjoy actually creating them. I'm not sure why it's taken me this so long to figure out or why it feels like such a terrible thing to confess.

With the move back to DevOps, 2020 is going to be full of an enormous number of things to learn for work. I think I need to trust that the system is going to work this time and focus my recreational learning on the process of learning and the ludic turns it sometimes takes.

Worst case scenario: I'm completely wrong and I get fired for overrreach. My experience says that prepping for this doesn't help lessen the impact much so I might as well just do what brings me joy.
